# :tropical_drink: Gin-n-Juice
A web framework

## What is it?

### :cocktail: Gin
The router and controller, routes are declared like this:

```
route('/path', 'template name', function() {
  this.yourVar = "Declared variables can be interpolated into templates!";
});
```

### :tangerine: Juice
The templater, takes your template and interpolates js using the dank syntax:
``` #{yo= yourVar } ``

## :mask: Testing
Unit testing done using [jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/), the tests can be found in ```test/spec```

Run the test in the browser by opening ```test/SpecRunner.html```

## :sweat: Still left to do!

- Find a more effienct way of pulling in templates.
