# :tropical_drink: Gin-n-Juice-News

## What is it?

A small application that pulls ten recent headlines from the guardian, and adds a short summary of the
page content. It is built on top of our web framework [Gin-n-Juice](https://github.com/elena-vi/Gin-n-Juice).

### How do I use it?

At the simplest level, it can be up and running in just four console commands (assuming npm is installed and
you are using an OS X machine):
```
$ git clone https://github.com/elena-vi/Gin-n-Juice-News.git
```
```
$ cd Gin-n-Juice-News
```
```
$ npm install
```
```
$ npm start
```

Then you should have your own instance of this application running at ``` http://localhost:3000 ```

### Editing your version

For information about how to make changes to your copy of this application, we would recommend looking at the
documentation of [Gin-n-Juice](https://github.com/elena-vi/Gin-n-Juice) itself.
